### Result
The retail Sales dataset was visualized, and a total of 456K was generated, while the average transaction amount is 456. Three product categories generated revenue from the retail sales data: Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics. Electronics contributed the highest revenue, with a total of 157K, followed by Clothing with 156K and Beauty with 144 K.
The insights revealed that Electronics generated the highest revenue across all segments, including gender, age range, and yearly sales. Clothing accounted for approximately 0.64% less revenue than Electronics. The Beauty category generated the least income among the three.
May recorded the highest revenue for both Electronics and Clothing, with total revenues of 23K and 17K, respectively. On the other hand, the Beauty category peaked in July with 16K, potentially due to increased demand for personal care products during summer vacations or holiday preparations. 

### Recommendations
- Focusing on Electronics since it generates the highest revenue across all segments by running targeted promotions, expanding product range, or improving inventory levels to meet demand.
- Plan promotional events for each season within a year to boost sales. This can be done by incorporating discounts, bundles, or exclusive offers.
- Increase the visibility of Beauty products together with other categories during high-performing months.
- Exploring customer demographics to understand preferences better, such as the age groups or genders that are driving sales in each category.
